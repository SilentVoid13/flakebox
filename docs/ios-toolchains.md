# iOS Toolchains

Compiling to iOS target requires globally installed `xcode`,
and is therefore only possible in development shell.

In essence all tools are pointing at `/usr/bin/clang` and
similar. Better than nothing.

Please get in touch if you know of a way to improve it.

Toolchain short-names:

* `aarch64-ios`
* `aarch64-ios-sim`
* `x86_64-ios`
