# Rustshop Flakebox - Rust dev experience (DX) we can share and love.

* Integrate best Rust dev tooling and practices into your project in seconds.
* Learn, customize, improve and share as a part of the DX-focused community.
* Keep up to date with the evolving ecosystem with ease.

Rustshop is a vision of how working with Rust could and should be like.
Flakebox is all you need to bring that vision into your Rust project.

Just because you're a lone Open Source developer working on a spare
time project doesn't mean you don't deserve a DX of a mature team
with dedicated tooling team. Just because you're a part of dedicated
tooling system in a mature team, doesn't mean you shouldn't benefit
from all the best ideas wider community has to offer.

You don't have to copy, paste and keep updating the same set of of
scripts between tens of your projects.

There's a better way: Flakebox.

**Warning:** Rustshop Flakebox is currently very immature. Expect
rought edges and some amount of churn before we figure out the
core pieces. We're currently targeting developers already using
Nix Flakes and Nix Development shells that are interested in
more active partipation.
